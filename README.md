## How to Contribute

Hacktoberfest'24 encourages contributions from everyone, regardless of their experience level. You can choose between two different contribution tiers:

### Tier 1: Core Repository Contributions

In this tier, you contribute directly to the official Hacktoberfest'24 core repository. Follow these steps:

1. **Find an Issue**: Check the [Issues tab](../../issues) and look for issues with `[ISSUE]` in the title. These are curated by the maintainers.
2. **Create an Issue**: If you find a bug or want to propose a feature, you can create a new issue with `[ISSUE]` in the title.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you've made the necessary changes, submit a pull request following this naming convention:
    ```
    pr-add-<your-name>-<PR-number>
    ```
    Example: `pr-add-johndoe-123`.

### Tier 2: External Repository Contributions

You also have the freedom to contribute to any **external open-source repository** of your choice. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Choose an External Repository**: Find an open-source repository you want to contribute to.
2. **Get Your PR Merged**: Submit a pull request to the external repository and get it merged successfully.
3. **Create an Issue in This Repo**: Once your external PR is merged, head over to the [Issues tab](../../issues) in this repository, and create an issue titled `[PR EXTERNAL] <your name>`.
4. **Submit Your Details**: In your issue, provide the following information:
    - Your Name
    - GitHub Username
    - PR Number
    - Link to the PR
    - A brief description of your contribution
5. **Update Participants Log**: Once verified by a maintainer, you will be instructed to update the `participants/participants.js` file (see below for more details).

## Leaderboard and Participants Log

After your contribution (either in Tier 1 or Tier 2) has been successfully verified, you will be featured on our **Leaderboard**! Here's how to update the `participants/participants.js` file:

1. Open `participants/participants.js`.
2. **If this is your first contribution**, add your details in the following format:
    ```js
    {
        id: "<incremental id>",
        name: "<Your Name>",
        university: "<Your University>",
        img: <your image variable>,
        pr: [<PR number>],
        prLink: ['<PR link>'],
    },
    ```

3. **If you have already made contributions before**, **do not create a new entry**. Instead, simply add your new PR number and PR link to the existing entry. For example, if your entry looks like this:
    ```js
    {
        id: "2",
        name: "John Doe",
        university: "Graphic Era University",
        img: johnDoe,
        pr: [1, 2],
        prLink: ['#link1', '#link2'],
    },
    ```
   And now you have a new PR (PR number: 3, PR link: `#link3`), you would update the `pr` and `prLink` arrays as follows:
    ```js
    {
        id: "2",
        name: "John Doe",
        university: "Graphic Era University",
        img: johnDoe,
        pr: [1, 2, 3],
        prLink: ['#link1', '#link2', '#link3'],
    },
    ```

4. Make sure to follow the structure carefully, including your PR number(s) and link(s).
